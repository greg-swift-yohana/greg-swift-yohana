## Exploring me
### Three honest, unfiltered things about me. You should know this to get the best from me or interacting with me.
* When I'm speaking up its because I feel deeply that its worth it to do so. I'm strong willed and opinionated, but I am open to discussion and being convinced to change. I know I can be wrong or that often its a matter of preference or opinion.
* I've got a fairly broad set of experience, not quite T-shaped, more like a cave with lots of stalactites. I make a lot of connections and will draw conclusions based on them.  If I'm wrong, explain it to me so I can adjust.
* I'm very self-analytical.  I do question how I handle conversations, situations, etc.  I re-evaluate my ideas regularly.  But I've also been doing this for so long and so much that I'm aware that I'm not always the problem.  If we conflict a lot, I may reach the point where I've decided its not me.

### What drives me nuts or irritates me
* The assumption that moving fast in the short term leads to long term success.
* When someone isn't willing to learn how to use something already in place before complaining about it (particularly if it does what they want, its just not the specific tool they asked for).  I hate a lot of the tools that I have to use on a regular basis, its unfortunately normal because the tools that win are rarely the best tools.
* [The double empathy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_empathy_problem)

### How can you earn a Gold Star (bonus points, favor, whatever) with me?
* Be willing to learn
* Be willing to help
* Be willing to understand

### WHAT ARE YOUR TOP THREE VALUES IN LIFE?
* Life before Death. Strength before Weakness. Journey before Destination.
* Complexity is inevitable with growth and time, putting thought into it early may seem like unnecessary complexity, but often times can help reduce the long term complexity.
